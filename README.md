# Generate-TV-Scripts
In this project, I have generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.


### Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

git clone https://github.com/ravijyoti3/Generate-TV-Scripts/
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.
